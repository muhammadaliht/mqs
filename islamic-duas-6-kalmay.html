    <p class="text1 mb-3">
Kalma means "word" in Arabic. It usually refers to the Shahada, a significant statement in Islam. The kalma لَآ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اﷲُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَّسُوْلُ اﷲِ states that “No one is worthy of worship except Allah, & Muhammad is His Messenger." The Shahada shows that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. This statement is the central belief in Islam—that Allah is one and Muhammad is a prophet. 
<br> <br>
Islam has six kalmay: the first kalma, second kalma, third kalma, fourth kalma, fifth kalma, & sixth kalma. Saying these Kalmay is super essential for Muslims; it proves their acceptance of Islam and their commitment to its beliefs. The Shahada plays a significant role in Islamic teachings. It acts as a unifying declaration for Muslims all around the world.
<br> <br>
The Six Kalmay, or the Six Phrases, are necessary Islamic faith declarations that guide Muslims. These lines, often said during important events and in everyday prayers, serve as a reminder of fundamental Islamic values. They are based on numerous hadiths and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and are incredibly well-liked by Muslims worldwide. Parents are responsible for encouraging their children to say and learn these kalmay very first.

    <p class="text1" style="">In Islam, the fourth Kalima, or Kalima Tawheed, is a vital statement of Allah's oneness. This kalima highlights the most important concept of Tawheed, which holds that Allah alone—who is one and has no partners—is the only creator deserving of worship. The complete fourth Kalima is <strong>"There is no god but Allah; He is One; He has no partners; the kingdom and the praise belong to Him. "He is the Ever-Living who never dies; He is the one who both creates and grants life.". Everything is in His hands, and He is in charge of everything.</strong>

    The fourth Kalima, which expresses the principles of Islamic monotheism, is essential reading for all Muslims.

    <h2 class="hdg3">Learn 5th Kalma: Istaghfar (Seeking forgiveness)</h2>
    <p class="text1" style="">In Islam, the Fifth Kalma, or Kalima Istaghfar, is a vital invocation focusing on begging Allah (SWT) for mercy for intentional or unintentional sins. Its significance lies in recognizing human imperfection and Allah's divine mercy to His creation. 
<br> <br>
Here is the 5th Kalma in English translation:
<strong>
"Asking for Forgiveness, which is saying: I ask forgiveness of Allah, my Lord, for every sin I committed intentionally or wrongly, secretly or openly. And I repent to Him from the sin I know and do not know. You are the Knower of the unseen, the One who covers the mistakes, the Forgiver of sins. There is no might or power except by Allah, the Highest, and Great,"

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Importance of the 5th Kalma</h3>
    <p class="text1">The 5th Kalma profoundly reminds Muslims to consider their deeds and ask Allah for forgiveness constantly. This is particularly significant during everyday prayers and times of meditation. With pure intentions and lovely names—especially "Allah"—we confess our sins and ask for pardon. The phrase "And I repent to Him" emphasizes sincerity in both actions and hearts and confirms our determination to return to Allah.
Because of Allah's infinite kindness, even serious offenses like avoiding military duty are forgiven. Asking for forgiveness has many advantages.

    <h2 class="hdg3">Learn Daily Duas/Masnoon Duas</h2>
    <p class="text1" style="">The daily prayers, or du'a as they are known in Arabic, are very important to Muslims. These prayers help ask Allah for the right direction, blessings, and more. When children grow up, teaching them about the world and religion is very important. 
<br> <br>
Parents are responsible for teaching children the daily recited prayers (duas). Such as prayer before eating the meal and prayer after eating the meal; prayer before drinking water and prayer after drinking water; prayer before going to the washroom and prayer coming out of the washroom; and prayer before sleeping. And prayer after sleep, prayer for going upstairs and prayer for going downstairs, prayer for the funeral of an adult, prayer for the funeral of a little (infant) child, and prayer for the funeral of a little (infant) girl, prayer for entering the house and prayer for leaving the house, prayer for traveling, prayer after sitting in a vehicle, and hundreds of prayers recited in life should be learned.
<br> <br>
At our best online Quran school, expert male and female online teachers teach children and adults the online Quran, help them live according to the Sunnah, and beautify this world and the hereafter. Muslims recite several duas depending on the circumstance. For instance, there's one dua before sleeping and one after waking up. There are also some duas for going into and coming out of homes, as well as duas before eating the meal and after eating the meal.
<br> <br>
Muslims ensure to say prayers before and after drinking milk and water and dua for entering and exiting the toilet! Additionally, there are specific duas for going downstairs or upstairs. Through these prayers, Muslims can express gratitude, seek guidance, and maintain a close relationship with Allah daily. By adding du'as into their daily routines, Muslims try to regain their faith, seek Allah's mercy, and experience inner peace and strength.

<!--section 10  Types of Islamic Duas -->
<div class="container my-4 px-3">
   
    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3">Types of Islamic Duas / Daily Supplications</h2>
    <p class="text1" style="">There are many types and purposes for daily supplications. Some common categories include:</p>
    
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Morning and Evening Supplications (Adhkar)</h3>
    <p class="text1">Adhkār, or morning and evening prayers, are crucial daily Islamic rituals. Remembering Allah through these supplications provides spiritual protection and direction. Before sunrise, morning prayers are offered after Fajr, and evening prayers are offered after Maghrib but before darkness. Adhkār are used to thank Allah for His blessings and protection from evil. These Duas usually relate to health, safety, and guidance. Many Hadiths state that saying duas during these periods is more likely to be answered; these are exceptionally excellent times for prayer. Our best online Quran tutors teach morning and evening Adhkar to you and your child.</p>


    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Supplications for Forgiveness (Istighfar)</h3>
    <p class="text1">Doing forgiveness prayers, or istighfar, is very important in Islam. Asking Allah for forgiveness is necessary for spiritual development and peace of mind. Saying "Astaghfirullah," which means "I seek forgiveness from Allah," several times is one of the easiest and most powerful ways to perform Istighfar. Reciting this sentence at least 100 times a day is advised by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Abdullah bin Abbas (RA) reported the Messenger of Allah stated: The person who consistently offers Istighfaar, or frequent forgiveness to Allah Ta'aala for mistakes, will have a way out of poverty and hardship. All the hardships and suffering will go, and happiness and prosperity will take their place. One will find nourishment in unexpected and unexpected places.
<br> <br>
Istighfar is more significant than just a spoken recital because it represents a genuine desire to turn from one's sins. Feeling regret for one's mistakes, actively turning to God, and deciding not to sin again. Making forgiveness duas decreases worry and provides access to blessings and nourishment. Istighfar is a doorway to relieving oneself of responsibilities and elevating happiness.
<br>  <br>
There are many additional duas drawn from the Quran and Hadith that can be said for forgiveness. For example ,رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ
"Our Lord, give us [that which is] excellent in this world and the Hereafter, and protect us from the fire's punishment." These prayers remind believers of Allah's generosity and strengthen their relationship with Him. Regularly practicing these supplications promotes an attitude of humility and appreciation, guiding people toward a more virtuous life.</p>


          
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Supplication for Hidaya</h3>
    <p class="text1">Islam emphasizes the dua for hidayah, or prayers for guidance, which are derived from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). He highlighted the significance of asking Allah for guidance in every aspect of life, emphasizing that asking for advice is a sign of humility and faith. According to a well-known hadith, Allah hears every prayer and answers them by providing what is asked for or preventing the equivalent amount of harm. 
"O Allah, guide me among those whom You have guided; and protect me among those whom You have protected" is a commonly said dua for guidance. This prayer emphasizes the believer's dependence on Allah's wisdom to overcome challenges in life.</p>

<!--section  11 The Significance of Islamic-->
<div class="container my-4 px-3">
   
    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3">The Significance of Islamic Masnoon Duas/Daily Supplication in Islam</h2>
    <p style="">It is important to say duas daily to build a strong spiritual bond with Allah. Muslims can freely communicate their ideas, worries, and desires with Allah SWT when they pray. This connection provides support and the right direction in the challenges of life. Regular supplications or Islamic duas strengthen believers' trust and belief in Allah's wisdom.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Gratitude and Humility</h3>
    <p class="text1">Gratitude is expressed through supplication. People who frequently give gratitude to Allah for his blessings develop a grateful mindset. This practice develops humility because Muslims know their limits and the vastness of Allah's mercy. By acknowledging life's good and bad sides, Dua promotes emotional and mental stability by encouraging a balanced attitude. </p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Healing and Mental Health</h3>
    <p class="text1">In mental health, the therapeutic advantages of regular prayer are becoming more widely acknowledged. The practice of dua offers a safe environment for expressing one's deepest emotions, which helps reduce tension, worry, and sadness. Numerous studies indicate that engaging in spiritual activities, such as supplication, might enhance mental health and emotional resilience.</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Community and Social Support</h3>
    <p class="text1">In addition to being a private act, daily prayers can strengthen a sense of community. Gathering together to pray and offer up supplication strengthens ties within the community. When people share their struggles and prayers, the communal element of dua strengthens bonds between people and their common belief in Allah. This can only happen if everyone knows how to do dua</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Protection and Blessings</h3>
    <p class="text1 mb-4">Many Muslims believe that making regular Islamic dua is a call for protection from harm and bad luck. Duas are said in specific ways to avoid evil, damage, or disaster. Believers who hold this concept feel safe and at ease because they know Allah is watching them and their loved ones. Consistently focusing on positive things rather than negative ones through supplication can influence one's perspective.</p>
