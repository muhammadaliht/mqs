<!--section The Structure of Our Online Quran Courses For Kids in the USA -->
<div class="container my-4 px-3">
   
    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3">Structure of Our Online Quran Courses For Kids in the USA</h2>
    <p class="text1">Our online Quran school has carefully planned a Quran course structure that meets the unique needs of children who want to learn. Our main goal is to make learning enjoyable and valuable so the kids learn, love, and understand the Quran.</p>
   
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Introducing the Quran</h3>
    <p class="text1">Reading an introduction to the Quran is an essential first step in learning this holy book. The Quran is the most important book in Islam. It is more than just a religious work; it is also a complete guide for everyday life.
<br> <br>
Its chapters, or Surahs, lines, or Ayahs, talk about many different things, from spiritual advice to moral rules. It is essential to start with this step because it sets the stage for a more profound knowledge of the lessons in the Quran. Studying the history, compilation, and events surrounding the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) reveal of the Quran is all part of it. Learning to handle and read the Quran is another essential part of this level.
</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Learning the Correct Way To Pronounce and Write the Arabic Language</h3>
    <p class="text1">Learning the Arabic alphabet and how to pronounce words is one of the most important things you need to do to master the Quranic language. The first step is to teach kids the Arabic script, which has 28 letters, each with its own sound. Learning how to say these letters correctly is very important because even a tiny mistake in speech can change what words mean in Arabic. During this time, kids learn to recognize and say each letter through enjoyable activities, such as using visual aids and phonetic exercises and doing the same thing repeatedly. 
<br> <br>
Then, the focus moves to vowel sounds (Harakat) and other vital signs for pronunciation, like Sukoon (a letter that isn't spoken) and Shaddah (a letter that is doubled). Not only is this essential information necessary to read the Quran, but it's also necessary to talk and understand Arabic. Children prepare for a deeper and more accurate study of the Quran and Islam by learning the Arabic language and how to say its letters correctly.
</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">How To Read the Quran</h3>
    <p class="text1">The process of Basic Quran Reading is an essential first step in teaching kids about the Quran. Beginners are taught the basics of reciting the Quran during this critical phase. They start by learning the Arabic alphabet and how to say the letters. This step is crucial for building a good foundation for studying the Quran. Learning how to speak Arabic letters and words correctly is important because that is a key part of reading the Quran correctly. 
<br> <br>
There are rules for Tajweed that are taught to beginners so that students can learn how to read the Quran correctly from the beginning. Reading isn't the only important thing at this stage; it's also about connecting young minds with the divine words and building a strong bond with the Quran. It prepares kids for more complex levels, like learning the Quran by heart (Hifz) and understanding it (Tafseer).
</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Rules of Tajweed</h3>
    <p class="text1">Following Tajweed rules when learning the Quran is essential to a child's Islamic schooling. Tajweed, the art of reciting the Quran with the right tone and pronunciation, is needed to keep the text's beauty and truth. When kids learn the Quran according to Tajweed rules, they get better at reciting it and knowing what Allah wants them to do. 
<br> <br>
To do this, you need to know essential things like Makharij al-Huruf (articulation points), Sifaat-ul-Huruf (characteristics of letters), and how to use the Nun Sakinah and Tanween rules. As an essential part of Tajweed, you should also know how to correctly use Madd (elongation) methods and Qalqalah (echo sound). By teaching these rules along with the Quran from a young age, children learn to respect and love the Quran's precise language deeply. This ensures that future generations will continue the tradition of reading the Quran correctly and with sincerity.
</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Memorize the Quran: Learning By Heart (Hifz)</h3>
    <p class="text1">The most important part of our Quranic education program is where kids learn to memorize the Quran. This is called Hifz. Children must memorize the Quran as part of this critical and careful process. This takes a lot of hard work, discipline, and a deep love for the holy book. We teach Hifz in a way that is easy for kids to understand because we know every child learns and remembers things differently. We start with shorter surahs (chapters) and work our way up to longer ones so the kids can learn to remember things at their own pace.
<br> <br>
Rereading and revising the material over and over is an important part of the process because it helps the kids remember what they have learned. Our experienced Hifz teachers are always there to help, encourage, and give individualized advice, making the kids' spiritually rewarding trip more enjoyable and fulfilling. Our goal with this program is to raise a generation that loves the Quran and follows its lessons in their daily lives.
</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Understanding and Thinking</h3>
    <p class="text1">A major part of our online Quran classes for kids in the USA is helping them understand and think about the text. This vital part of learning goes beyond memorization and encourages kids to look into what the Quran texts mean. Interactive and age-appropriate teaching methods help them understand and think about what the Quran says, leading to a stronger spiritual connection and moral knowledge. This method allows them to learn more and shows them how to use what they've learned daily. </p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">The Combination of Islamic Studies</h3>
    <p class="text1">The Islamic Studies Combination piece is essential to our Quran Course Structure for Kids. This is especially true for kids who are learning the Quran online. Beyond the fundamental lessons of the Quran, we cover a wider range of Islamic subjects in this part of the curriculum. This all-around method ensures that kids learn to read and recite the Quran. understand it, and follow its rules. In our lessons, we talk about the life and beliefs of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), the Five Pillars of Islam, and how Islamic morals and ethics should be applied in everyday life. </p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Entertaining and Interactive Learning</h3>
    <p class="text1">We want kids to find our online Quran school an interesting and enjoyable place to learn the Quran. Quizzes and videos are just a few interactive ways our experienced tutors use to keep kids interested and motivated during the lessons. We know that kids' attention spans are short and that standard ways of teaching may get old quickly. We make our lessons entertaining and engaging so your child will enjoy learning the Quran and better understand the Islamic faith.</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Participation of Parents</h3>
    <p class="text1">Strong parental participation is a big part of our online Quran course for kids. We regularly inform parents about their child's progress and give them special instructions for helping at home. This includes giving each other advice on improving lessons and making the classroom a good place to learn. We also hold online workshops and meetings where parents can talk to teachers. This creates a collaborative learning environment beyond the virtual classroom and strengthens the family's relationship to the Quran.</p>
