    <p class="text1">Figuring out why regular online Quran classes are essential for kids.</p>
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">The Strength of the Islamic Faith</h3>
    <p class="text1">Millions worldwide follow the Quran, which is more than just a book. It is the 
guidance of Allah that changes their lives. Children who learn the Quran from a young age can benefit greatly in their brain and spiritual growth. Kids who take regular Quran classes learn a lot about Islamic beliefs, which helps them understand their faith and develop strong morals.

<!--section 5  Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Quran Classes for Kids.-->      
<div class="container my-4 px-3">
   
    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3">Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Quran Classes for Kids.</h2>
    <p class="text1">There are different levels of Quran classes for children to meet their needs and skill levels. Let's look at the three critical levels: basic, advanced, and advanced.</p>
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Beginner Level</h3>
    <p class="text1">At the beginning level, kids learn the basics of reading from the Quran. First, they learn the Arabic alphabet and how to say each letter correctly. They learn simple words and short sentences from the Quran as they go along. If they start at this level, they will have a strong understanding of the Quran as they grow.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Intermediate Level</h3>
    <p class="text1">Kids build on what they learned in the starting stage as they move on to the intermediate level. They learn new words and get better at scanning Arabic text. Through translation tasks, they also start to understand what the verses mean on a basic level. At this stage, they can learn more about the teachings of the Quran and feel more confident in their ability to recite it.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Advance Level</h3>
    <p class="text1">At the intermediate level, kids learn more about the Quran's more complicated ideas. They know how to tafsir (interpret) challenging verses and discuss the moral lessons that different chapters teach. Learning longer surahs or whole juz (parts) of the Quran may also be a goal for more advanced students. Our online school makes it easier than ever for kids to slowly learn this holy book by offering courses at different levels designed to fit their needs.</p>

<!--section 6  How to Choose the Best Teacher for Online Quran Learning-->
<div class="container my-4 px-3">
   
    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3">How to Choose the Best Teacher for Online Quran Learning</h2>
    <p class="text1">Selecting the appropriate Quran teacher is one of the most important parts of taking online classes for kids to learn the Quran. It's not enough for teachers to teach; they must also be role models and help kids develop a love for learning.</p>
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Find Out Your Child's Reading Level</h3>
    <p class="text1">First, finding a trained Quran teacher with experience working with children is essential. You should look for someone who knows a lot about Tajweed, knows the right way to say Arabic letters, and has suitable teaching methods.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Find a Teacher</h3>
    <p class="text1">Think about how the Quran teacher teaches and how they do it. They need to be gentle, supportive, and able to make the classroom enjoyable. A good teacher will know what each child is good and bad at and change how they teach based on that information.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Know Teachers' Background</h3>
    <p class="text1">Ensure that the Quran teacher shares your family's beliefs and ideals. It's essential for both you and your child to be happy with the mentor they choose. For online Quran learning to succeed, students and teachers must be able to trust each other.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Choosing Trustworthy Mentors</h3>
    <p class="text1">Finding the right Quran teacher is the first step to a rewarding online learning journey. With the help of a skilled guide who knows how to keep kids interested, your child can learn more about the Quran and develop a love for learning that will last a lifetime. So, choose a Quran teacher; it will make all the difference in how much pleasure you have gained.</p>

<!--section 7  Complementary Online Quran Courses for Kids-->   
<div class="container my-4 px-3">
   
    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3">Complementary Online Quran Courses for Kids</h2>
    <p class="text1">Learning the Quran opens a world of spiritual growth. Some other complementary Quran courses can help your child learn more about the holy book and understand it better than just reciting and memorizing it.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Daily Prayers / Masnoon Duas</h3>
    <p class="text1">Daily prayers, known as dua in Arabic, are essential to Muslim's day. These prayers help ask for guidance, blessings, & from Allah. Muslims say different duas for many situations. For example, there's one before sleeping and another after waking. They also have duas for before eating and after finishing a meal and ones for entering and leaving their homes.
<br> <br>
Remember the duas for going in and out of the bathroom and ones for drinking water & milk! There are also special duas for going upstairs or downstairs. These prayers help Muslims show thankfulness, ask for help, and keep a strong bond with Allah daily. By adding du'as into their daily habits, Muslims try to remember their faith, look for Allah's mercy, & feel peace and strength inside.
</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Benefits of Learning Daily Duas</h3>
    <p class="text1">Kids' daily supplication (Masnoon Duas) course is a great way to teach them Islamic ideals and help them build a strong relationship with Allah. This course teaches kids the most important duas for everyday things like getting up, eating, and going to bed. This helps them make remembering Allah a part of their daily lives. Children learn these prayers in an organized way that allows them to understand what they mean, which gives their spiritual journey meaning.
<br> <br>
Kids will enjoy and be interested in interactive daily supplication lessons. Children learn real duas from the Quran and Sunnah through individualised lessons taught by trained teachers. Using audiovisual tools and repeating things helps you remember them, which makes learning easier and more pleasant.
</p>
  
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Namaz / Salah </h3>
    <p class="text1">Namaz, which many call Salah, is a key form of worship (Ibadah) and Islam's initial fardh (obligation). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: "The first thing that Allah made obligatory upon my Ummah was the five prayers, and the first thing from their acts of worship that shall be taken up will be the five prayers." Namaz is how Muslims connect with Allah to ask for guidance, peace, and blessings.
<br> <br>
Salah includes a mix of physical & spiritual actions. It has recitations (Tilawat, Qirat, Fatihah) from the Quran and specific movements. These movements are standing (Qayam, Takbir), bowing (Ruku), prostrating (Sujud), & sitting (Tashahud, Ata'hayyat). The five daily prayers—Fajr (Two Rakah), Dhuhr (Four Rakah), Asr (Four Rakah), Maghrib (Three Rakah), and Isha (Four Rakah)—are a vital part of a Muslim's day. They remind us how important faith & devotion are. It is necessary to perform ablution before prayer.
</p>
  
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">6 Kalimay</h3>
    <p class="text1">Kalimah means "word" in Arabic. It often refers to the critical declaration of faith called the Shahada. The kalima لَآ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اﷲُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَّسُوْلُ اﷲِ means that “Nobody is worthy of worship except Allah & Muhammad is His Messenger”. The Shahada shows that there is no God but Allah & Muhammad is His Messenger. This statement is the central belief in Islam—showing that Allah is one & Muhammad is a prophet. Islam has six kalimas: the first kalma, second kalma, third kalma, fourth kalma, fifth kalma, & sixth kalma. Saying these Kalimay is super crucial for Muslims; it proves their acceptance of Islam & their commitment to its beliefs. The Shahada plays a significant role in Islamic teachings & acts as a unifying declaration for Muslims worldwide.
<br> <br>
The Kalimah in Islam, additionally called the Shahada, holds extensive importance because of the announcement of faith for Muslims. It's far a concise affirmation of the precious beliefs in Islam, اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَّآ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَہٗ لَاشَرِيْكَ لَہٗ وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهٗ وَرَسُولُہٗ pointing out that There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. This declaration of religion serves as the cornerstone of Islamic perception, emphasizing Allah's oneness and Muhammad's prophethood (Peace be upon Him). 
With the valuable resource of reciting the Kalimah (I endure witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that I undergo witness that Muhammad is His servant and his Messenger), Muslims are unique in their commitment to monotheism and the teachings of Islam, uniting believers globally underneath this essential creed.

    <h2 class="hdg3">Through Online Quran Classes, Encouraging a Love of Quran Learning.</h2>
    <p class="text1">Learning should never be challenging, especially for children. Because of this, Quran classes for kids are meant to stimulate not only information but also a genuine desire to learn. These classes do more than teach kids how to read and recite the Quran. They also make them want to learn more about the deepest parts of Islamic beliefs.</p>
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Kids Love the Quran</h3>
    <p class="text1">Kids grow closer to their faith by learning more about the significance and meanings of the Quran's texts. They start to understand that learning isn't just for school or classes but can be a lifelong process that makes them better in every way.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Developing Critical Thinking Skills</h3>

In Islamic lessons, they learn to ask questions, look for answers, and consider different points of view. This helps them find their unique way of knowing Islam and feeds their desire to learn.</p>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Creating Foundations for a Lifetime</h3>

    <h2 class="hdg3">Online Quran Memorization Program and Tajweed for Kids</h2>
    <p class="text1">for Kids
Anyone can be amazed at how hard it is to memorize the Quran, but it's even more impressive when kids do it. Online lessons can help kids learn the holy book at their own pace, with the help of experienced teachers who know how they learn best.</p>
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Learn Tajweed</h3>
    <p class="text1">Tajweed, the right way to say and read the Quran, is important in helping kids better understand it. Through online Quran lessons, kids can learn the complicated rules of Tajweed from trained teachers who help them practice slowly and correctly. This ensures that the lyrics are correct and makes you appreciate each line's beauty and rhythm.
Memorizing and learning Tajweed takes hard work and a lot of practice. Our online Quran school offers dynamic tools that keep kids interested in learning and make it enjoyable. Kids can figure out what they need to work on in their Quranic skills by getting personalized feedback from teachers during live meetings or through recorded lessons.
</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Different Exercises</h3>
    <p class="text1">Remember that memorizing the Quran is more than just knowing it by heart; you need to know what each word means. By combining memorization with comprehension exercises found in online classes, kids get closer to the messages of Allah and improve their ability to use what they've learned in everyday life.</p>

    <h2 class="hdg3">How to Learn and Read the Quran Online: More Advanced Quran Studies for Kids</h2>
    <p class="text1">As kids get better at studying the Quran, it is essential to move on to more complex topics, such as understanding it. Kids can learn more about the holy book and examine its profound messages and meanings during this stage.</p>
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Multiple Levels to Learn the Quran</h3>
    <p class="text1">In these advanced Quran lessons, kids learn about the different ways scholars try to figure out what the verses of the Quran mean. They also start to learn Tafseer, which explains certain verses or chapters' historical background, linguistic features, and context. This helps children understand Allah's word more deeply.</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">One Step Ahead</h3>
    <p class="text1">Furthermore, more challenging classes teach children how different meanings can exist based on the views of other scholars. Young readers can learn to think critically and spread their views by reading well-known Tafseer books covering various scholarly topics.</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Advance Level</h3>
    <p class="text1">Moving from simple memorization to understanding what the Holy Quran means is a big step forward in every child's learning. It strengthens their faith and gives them helpful information they can use for the rest of their lives. By encouraging a love of learning and interpretation from a young age, we can help raise a generation that values the beauty and knowledge in the Holy Book.</p>
