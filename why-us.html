    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3" style="">One-on-One Classes for Online Quran Learning</h2>
    
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"> Personalized Quran Learning</h3>
    <p class="text1">At Muhammadan Quran School, we know that each student has their own goals and wants regarding learning. That's why we offer personalized one-on-one classes as a core service, ensuring every student gets our complete care and the right kind of help. When students work with a teacher one-on-one, they get a personalized learning experience that fits their level, pace, and learning style. With this customized method, students can focus on subjects like Tajweed, memorize the Quran, or understand Quranic verses more deeply.</p>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"> Direct Communication with Teachers</h3>
    <p class="text1">The one-on-one approach allows the teacher and student to talk directly to each other, so feedback and corrections can happen right away. For example, when a student is practicing recitation, the teacher can immediately fix pronunciation or articulation mistakes. It ensures that the student fully understands the rules of Tajweed. This close contact is significant for getting good at reciting and understanding the Quran, which takes practice and focused attention</p>


    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"> Customized Lesson Plans</h3>
    <p class="text1">Our highly trained male and female Quran teachers change the lessons to fit the needs of each student. The freedom of one-on-one classes ensures lessons are tailored to each student's specific learning goals, whether they are a beginner just starting or someone who wants to improve their skills in reciting the Quran. This method helps students improve their skills and makes them feel better about themselves and more motivated as they see steady progress in a safe space.</p>


    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"> Suitable Scheduling Options</h3>
    <p class="text1">One-on-one online Quran lessons also give you the most schedule freedom. Parents and students can pick times that work with their schedules, making it easier for them to learn the Quran despite being busy. This service is invaluable for students who live in different time zones or have other obligations.</p>


    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"> Comfortable Environment for Learning</h3>
    <p class="text1">Also, the privacy and focus of one-on-one Quran lessons make them perfect for shy or nervous students. Students who aren't in a group feel freer to ask questions, clear up any confusion, and interact fully with the teacher. It makes it easier to understand the Quran and gets people involved in the learning process.</p>


    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"> Dedication to Personal Development</h3>

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"> Monitoring Student Progress</h3>
    <p class="text1">Using assessment reports to monitor and improve our students' progress is crucial to Muhammadan Quran School's dedication to offering top-notch Quranic teaching.
