    <h2 class="hdg3">Overview of Online Arabic Classes</h2>
    <p class="text1 mb-4">Arabic is one of the world's most popular and widely spoken languages because of its social, international, and religious significance. For millions of Muslims worldwide, Arabic is the key to understanding the Quran. It is also a holy language and a gateway to a rich literary, historical, and cultural heritage. Arabic students, especially those interested in the Quran, look to online Arabic classes as a convenient approach to learn Arabic online.
<br> <br>
Online Arabic classes with expert tutors have changed how people learn the language because they offer flexibility and convenience that traditional classrooms don't. Online Arabic course is suitable for beginners learning the Arabic alphabet and intermediate learners improving their understanding of text and Quranic translation.
<br> <br>
One great thing about Arabic lessons online is that they let you adjust your lessons to your needs. Online Arabic course allows students to learn at their desired schedules with experienced professors. This helps students manage their personal and professional lives while learning Arabic online.
<br> <br>
Arabic lessons online are important for learning the Quran. The Quran is written in classical Arabic, which non-native speakers may find difficult. An online Arabic course teaches Quranic verse meanings, grammar, and vocabulary. Understanding the sacred book in its original language is essential.

    <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
    <h2 class="hdg3">Structure of Online Arabic Classes: Learn Arabic Online</h2>
   <p class="text1">Online Arabic classes should be set up well so that students of all skill levels can learn it, from those who are just starting to those who are proficient. The structure should also ensure that students learn the basics of the Arabic language well before moving on to more complex topics, primarily if the course is meant to teach Quranic Arabic. 
<br> <br>
Here is an idea for how online Arabic lessons could be set up in different modules:
</p>
  
   <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Module 1: Introduction to Arabic Alphabet and Pronunciation</h3>
    <p class="text1">The Arabic alphabets are the most important thing you must understand to start learning Arabic. You need to know it to learn Modern Standard Arabic and Quranic Arabic. Arabic is written from right to left, not left to right. It has 28 letters, and each one looks different. Also, some Arabic words don't appear in English. For example, the "ع" (Ayn) or the "ق" (Qaaf). Learning these sounds is very important because how they are read affects the meaning.
    <br> <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Ensure the kids learn to write and speak Arabic letters and some basic vocabulary.</span>
    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Learn about the shapes, sounds, and writing forms of Arabic letters.</span>
    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Getting better at pronouncing words correctly, including sounds that are only found in Arabic, like "ع" (Ayn) and "ق" (Qaf).</span>
        <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Start with essential Arabic words, like greetings, numbers, and family terms.</span>
        <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Learning the difference between long and short sounds (Harakat).</span>
    </p>
    
    

  <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Module 2: Basic Grammar and Sentence Making</h3>
    <p class="text1">You must understand basic grammar and sentence structure to build a good foundation in Arabic. A subject-verb-object (SVO) structure is what most Arabic words look like. Still, it can be different in formal or Quranic Arabic. The language has gendered names (masculine and feminine) and case endings (nominative, accusative, and genitive). Using personal names and verb conjugations for present, past, and future tenses will help students form simple sentences.
    <br> <br>

    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Introduction to noun-verb-adjective sentences.</span>

    <br>
    </p>  
    
          
    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Module 3: Everyday Conversation and Vocabulary Expansion</h3>
    <p class="text1">Effective daily Arabic conversation requires a vast vocabulary. Students practice greetings, common questions, numbers, time, and place phrases in this stage. Thematic vocabulary like food, family, and travel helps learners navigate daily life. Mastery of fundamental phrases such as "As-salaam alaykum" (Peace be upon you) or "Shukran" (Thank you) allows learners to interact with native speakers.
    <br> <br>

    </p>   
    

 <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Module 4: Introduction to Quranic Arabic</h3>
    <p class="text1">Quranic Arabic has an extensive vocabulary, complicated grammar, and other unique features. In contrast to Modern Standard Arabic, Quranic Arabic has rules about using grammar and words that differ from how people talk in everyday life. Online Arabic lessons introduce students to essential words, phrases, and expressions found in the most important book in Islam. Students understand the spiritual background of Islamic beliefs in an online Arabic course.

    <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Module 5: Sentence Structure and Advanced Grammar</h3>
    <p class="text1">Students learn more about making complicated Arabic sentences and grammar at this stage. There are a lot of complex structures in Arabic sentences, especially in the Quran. These include conditional sentences, passive voice, and relative clauses. To make more complex sentences, you must know how to use word cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive) and verb conjugations in different tenses. You can better grasp and translate Quranic verses by mastering these tough grammatical concepts.
    <br> <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Focusing on complicated sentence structures and how to use them in advance, as well as Quranic Arabic, will improve your advanced grammar skills.</span>

 <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Module 6: Advanced Quranic Arabic</h3>
    <p class="text1">Advanced Arabic grammar covers the complicated linguistic patterns needed to master Quranic and Modern Standard Arabic. At this level, students learn complex verb forms, noun declensions, and sentence patterns. Students must understand nouns and verbs' subjunctive, jussive, dual, and plural forms to learn Arabic online. Arabic syntax, including word order and subject-verb-adjective agreement, is also studied.
    <br> <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="">Improve your comprehension of advanced Quranic Arabic, including rare words and complex grammatical patterns.</span>

 <h3 class="hdg13 mb-0 mt-3"><img src="pictures/card1.png" class="subHeadingImage" alt="">Module 7: Final Project and Review</h3>
    <p class="text1">Another important part of online Arabic learning is the final project and review, which lets you show off the skills you've learned. You will use what you know about vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure to translate and explain a short surah or line from the Quran for the project. This activity helps you learn more about Arabic and its holy meanings. The lesson will review all the important things you learned in the course.

    <br> <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="subheadingpage">Learning the Alphabet: </span>Arabic is written from right to left, so learning the script is essential. At this stage, students practice writing and recognizing letters in their isolated, initial, medium, and final forms.
    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="subheadingpage">Pronunciation: </span>Some Arabic sounds are not found in English, like "ز" (Ayn) and "ق" (Qaf), which makes pronunciation very hard for beginners.

    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="subheadingpage">Complex Sentences:</span>This is where students start to make more complicated sentences, such as questions, negations, and compound sentences. They also learn how different sentence structures work, like how to put adjectives after nouns.
    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="subheadingpage">Verb Conjugation:</span>You will learn more about verb conjugations, such as the past, present, and future tenses, as well as unusual verbs. This makes using roots and patterns (called "triliteral roots") more common.

They might use Quranic Arabic or Classical Arabic, which needs a specific understanding of older phrases, vocabulary, and structures.
    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="subheadingpage">Mastering Different Languages: </span> Most people learn Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for formal situations, but at the advanced level, many students also study other Arabic languages, like Egyptian Arabic, Levantine Arabic, and Gulf Arabic, to speak quickly with people from those areas.
    <br>
    <i class="fa fa-circle listDot mx-lg-3"></i><span class="subheadingpage">Writing and Speaking Mastery: </span>Students improve their writing and speaking skills by writing and speaking Arabic logically and subtly. They might take part in talks or debates or write formal essays.
